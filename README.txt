The source code of SDFNet and it's example on the Moving MNIST dataset are available to support our paper energetically. 

We proposed the command to download the Moving MNIST dataset at "./ data/moving_mnist/download_mmnist.sh"

The model figure is on “./ figures/ SDFNet.png”

If you have any questions about this code, please contact us through email.
